# Python-Calculator
This is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus operations
I made the user input his/her choice and the output was in float format. I didn't use integers since our daily calculator outputs in float
## P.S:
This is also an assignment from #I4GZuri Scholarship Program, 2022
